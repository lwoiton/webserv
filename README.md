# 42 Project Webserv - HTTP Server Implementation

## Project Overview

This project, Webserv, is part of the School 42 curriculum. The goal is to create a fully functional HTTP server in C++98, capable of handling various HTTP methods, serving static content, and managing CGI scripts.

## Task Description

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Implement a HTTP server using C++98.
2. Handle GET, POST, and DELETE HTTP methods.
3. Serve static websites.
4. Manage file uploads from clients.
5. Implement proper error handling and default error pages.
6. Use non-blocking I/O operations.
7. Handle multiple ports as specified in the configuration file.
8. Ensure compatibility with web browsers.

## Our Approach

In tackling this project, we have adopted the following approach:

1. Extensive research on HTTP protocols and server architectures.
2. Careful study of relevant RFCs to ensure compliance with HTTP standards.
3. Implementation of core server functionalities step by step.
4. Continuous testing and debugging to ensure robust performance.
5. Documentation of the process and key decisions in the Research.md file.
