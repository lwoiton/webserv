# Approach
Since we have no Idea about HTTP server we first need to read and understand basic underlying concepts.
This includes reading relevant Information about the follwoing topics:
1. Networking: Familiarize yourself with socket programming and the basics of TCP/IP communication. This will involve understanding concepts like IP addresses, ports, and socket operations.
2. HTTP Protocol: Learn about the HTTP protocol and its request/response structure. Understand the different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), status codes, and headers.
3. Multithreading: Since an HTTP server needs to handle multiple client connections simultaneously, you'll need to learn about multithreading or asynchronous programming to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
4. File I/O: HTTP servers often serve static files, so understanding file I/O operations in C++ will be essential.

2. HTTP Protocol:
	- "HTTP: The Definitive Guide" by David Gourley and Brian Totty
	- Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) HTTP Guide: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guide
3. Multithreading in C++:
	- "C++ Concurrency in Action" by Anthony Williams
	- "Effective Modern C++" by Scott Meyers (Chapter 6: "Lambda Expressions")
4. File I/O in C++:
	- "C++ Primer" by Stanley B. Lippman, Jos√©e Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo (Chapter 10: "Input and Output")
