# Approach
Since we have no Idea about HTTP server we first need to read and understand basic underlying concepts.
This includes reading relevant Information about the follwoing topics:
1. Networking: Familiarize yourself with socket programming and the basics of TCP/IP communication. This will involve understanding concepts like IP addresses, ports, and socket operations.
2. HTTP Protocol: Learn about the HTTP protocol and its request/response structure. Understand the different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), status codes, and headers.
3. Multithreading: Since an HTTP server needs to handle multiple client connections simultaneously, you'll need to learn about multithreading or asynchronous programming to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
4. File I/O: HTTP servers often serve static files, so understanding file I/O operations in C++ will be essential.

# Summary of the Ressources
## Networking from Beej's Guide to Network Programming:
### Chapter 2: What is a Socket?
#### 2.1 What are sockets?
A way to speak to other programs using standard Unix file descriptors. Everything on Unix is a file and I/O is always done by reading/writing from/to a file descriptor.

#### 2.2 Where do I get the this file descriptor?
A call to `socket()`. Then you can communicate via `send()` and `recv()` (use man).
`read()` and `write()` would also work, but prior functions offer much more control over the data transmission.
There are lots of different types of sockets, but for the HTTP server we just need Internet sockets for now.

#### 2.3 Are there several types of Internet sockets?
Yes, there are many however we for now focus on two types of sockets. One is the "Stream Socket" also refered to as "SOCK_STREAM" and the other is the "Datagram Socket" also refered to as "SOCK_DGRAM" and sometimes called "connectionless socket".

#### 2.4 What is a "SOCK_STREAM"?
Stream sockets are reliable two-way connected communication stream. They work like pipes with the FIFO method.

#### 2.5 What uses Stream Sockets?
`telnet` (`man telnet`) and `ssh` applications for example use stream sockets. The web browser with HTTP also uses Stream Sockets to get pages.
To get an first idea on how it works, you can try to telnet to a website over port 80. Type the following example into the command line: `telnet google.com 80`. It will open telnet with a prompt `telnet>` then type	"GET / HTTP/1.0" and hit RETURN twice. Then you will recieve the response from the server.
```
user@hostname: ~/cwd$ telnet google.com 80'
telnet> GET / HTTP/1.0

(HTTP Response)
```
#### 2.6 How do stream sockets achieve this high level of data transmission quality?
They use a protocol called TCP (Transmission Control Protocoll) (`man TCP`) which makes sure that the data arrives sequentually and error-free. It is usually seen paired with IP (Internet Protocoll) as TCP/IP, where IP deals primarily with the routing and TCP ensures the data integrity.

#### 2.7 What is a "SOCK_DGRAM"? Why are they also called connectionless sockets?
Connectionless sockets are called so because they do not establish a persistent connection between the sender and receiver. Instead, they send discrete packets of data called datagrams. Each datagram is independent and self-contained, containing all the necessary information for the receiver to process it. This means the packet might arrive or not arrive. If it arrives, the data within the datagram will be error-free.
Those sockets use IP, but instead of TCP they use UDP (User Datagram Protocol).


#### 2.8 What Datagram Sockets used for?
Datagram sockets are often used in scenarios where a reliable, ordered delivery of data is not required, and where the focus is on lightweight, low-latency communication. Examples of applications that use datagram sockets include DNS (Domain Name System) and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). Another examples include online gaming, audio and video streaming and video conferencing. For example YouTube always preloads videos so the video can keep running even if the internet connection drops for a moment. If packets are dropped in online games, it usually leads to well known "lags".
Some applications like `tftp` (trivial file transfer protocol, a little brother to FTP) or `dhcpcd` transfer binary applications from one host to another, so nothing can be lost. Well in this case for example `tftp` waits for the recepient to sent a packet back that aknowledges a successfull reception. If it is not recieved in a certain amount of time, the package will be retransmitted. This procedure is extremly important to ensure reliable `SOCK_DGRAM` applications.

#### 2.9 Network Theory and encapsulation
`SOCK_DGRAM` packets are built through encapsulation, which means each protocoll adds another another layer of encapsulation:

<img src="images/encapsulation.png" alt="Data Encapsulation" width="300"/>

A packet is born, the packet is wrapped ("encapsulated") in a header (and rarely a footer) by the first
protocol (say, the TFTP protocol), then the whole thing (TFTP header included) is encapsulated again by
the next protocol (say, UDP), then again by the next (IP), then again by the final protocol on the hardware
(physical) layer (say, Ethernet).
When another computer receives the packet, the hardware strips the Ethernet header, the kernel strips the
IP and UDP headers, the TFTP program strips the TFTP header, and it finally has the data.
The *Layered Network Model* aka "ISO/OSI":

<img src="images/iso_osi.png" alt="OSI 7 Layers" width="700"/>

The next model has less Layers, however the following model is more consistent with Unix and the idea of encapsulation:
- Application Layer (telnet, ftp, etc.)
- Host-to-Host Transport Layer (TCP, UDP)
- Internet Layer (IP and routing)
- Network Access Layer (Ethernet, wi-fi, or whatever)
Stream Sockets just need to `send()` the data out, while datagram sockets need to encapsulate the data with another method and then `sendto()` another host.
The kernel builds the Transport and Internet Layer while the hardware does the Network Access Layer.


### Chapter 3: IP Addresses, Structs and Data Munging
#### 3.1 IP Addresses, versions 4 and 6
We ran out of IPv4 Adresses because they were generously allocated to companies and there are just so many computers, espacially small computers such as phones, IoT and so on around the world.So IPv6 was born.
Here is a small table comparing IPv4 and IPv6:
| IPv4 | IPv6 |
|------|------|
| Uses 32-bit addresses | Uses 128-bit addresses |
| Provides approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses | Provides approximately 340 undecillion unique addresses |
| Address format: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx | Address format: xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx |
| Uses decimal notation | Uses hexadecimal notation |
| Less efficient in terms of address space | More efficient in terms of address space |
| Limited support for built-in security features | Built-in support for IPsec and other security features |
| Network address translation (NAT) is commonly used to conserve IPv4 addresses | No need for NAT due to the abundance of IPv6 addresses |
| Widely used and supported | Adoption is still ongoing |
| Loopback adress: 127.0.0.1 | Loopback adress: ::1 |
| 192.0.2.33 | ::ffff:192.0.2.33 |

#### 3.2 Subnets
Subnetting should be clear through the previous 42 project on subnetting. As in IPv4 IPv6 also allowes the use of subnet masks aka a slash followed the number of network bits:
`192.0.2.12/30` and int IPv6 `2001:db8::/32` or `2001:db8:5413:4028::9db9/64`

#### 3.4 Port numbers
It's a 16-bit number that's like the local address for the connection.
Think of the IP address as the street address of a hotel, and the port number as the room number.
Different services on the Internet have different well-known port numbers. ([the big IANA Port List](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml))(on Unix: `/etc/services`)

#### 3.5 Byte Order
- Big-Endian: The most significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address.
- Little-Endian: The least significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address.
- Network Byte Order: Big-Endian is used for transmitting data over the network.
- Host Byte Order: The byte order used by the host machine.

Example:
Let's say we have a 16-bit integer with the value 0x1234 (hexadecimal). In Big-Endian, it would be stored as 0x12 0x34, with the most significant byte (0x12) at the lower memory address. In Little-Endian, it would be stored as 0x34 0x12, with the least significant byte (0x34) at the lower memory address.

Network Byte Order is important for network communication because different machines may have different byte orders. To ensure interoperability, network protocols specify that data should be transmitted in Big-Endian order. Host Byte Order refers to the byte order used by the machine running the program. When sending or receiving data over the network, the program needs to convert between Network Byte Order and Host Byte Order to ensure correct interpretation of the data.
The following functions help to convert between Host and Network Byte Order:
| Function     | Description              |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| `htons()`    | **h**ost **to** **n**etwork **s**hort    |
| `htonl()`    | **h**ost **to** **n**etwork **l**ong     |
| `ntohs()`    | **n**etwork **to** **h**ost **s**hort    |
| `ntohl()`    | **n**etwork **to** **h**ost **l**ong     |

#### 3.6 Data structs
A socket descriptor is of type `int`.
The `addrinfo` structure is used in socket programming to store information about a network address. It is defined in the `<netdb.h>` header file.
```c
struct addrinfo
{
	int             ai_flags;       // AI_PASSIVE, AI_CANONNAME, etc.
	int             ai_family;      // AF_INET, AF_INET6, AF_UNSPEC
	int             ai_socktype;    // SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM
	int             ai_protocol;    // use 0 for "any"
	size_t          ai_addrlen;     // size of ai_addr in bytes
	struct sockaddr *ai_addr;       // struct sockaddr_in or _in6
	char            *ai_canonname;  // full canonical hostname
	struct addrinfo *ai_next;       // linked list, next node
};
```
- `ai_flags`:
	This member is used to specify additional options for the address resolution. Some common flags include AI_PASSIVE (for server sockets), AI_CANONNAME (to obtain the canonical name of the host), and AI_NUMERICHOST (to indicate that the host parameter is a numeric IP address).
- `ai_family`:
	This member specifies the address family, which can be AF_INET (IPv4), AF_INET6 (IPv6), or AF_UNSPEC (unspecified, allowing both IPv4 and IPv6).
- `ai_socktype`:
	This member specifies the socket type, which can be SOCK_STREAM (for TCP sockets) or SOCK_DGRAM (for UDP sockets).
- `ai_protocol`:
	This member specifies the protocol to be used. If set to 0, the system will choose the appropriate protocol based on the ai_family and ai_socktype.
- `ai_addrlen`:
	This member stores the size of the ai_addr structure in bytes.
- `ai_addr`:
	This member is a pointer to a sockaddr structure that represents the network address. The actual type of the structure depends on the address family (ai_family).
- `ai_canonname`:
	This member is a pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the canonical name of the host.
- `ai_next`:
	This member is a pointer to the next addrinfo structure in a linked list. It is used when multiple addresses are returned by the address resolution process. The addrinfo structure is commonly used with functions like `getaddrinfo()` (`man getaddrinfo()`) to perform address resolution and obtain a list of suitable addresses for network communication.

For the `struct sockaddr` can hold information for many types of sockets.
```c
struct sockaddr
{
	unsigned short  sa_family;      // address family, AF_xxx
	char            sa_data[14];    // 14 bytes of protocol address
};
```
- `sa_family`:
	Can be a variety of things, but for us it's important to know that it will be mostly either `AF_INET`(IPv4) or `AF_INET6`(IPv6).
- `sa_data`:
	Contains the a destination adress  and port numbers for the socket.

There are parallel structures such as `struct sockaddr_in` for IPv4 (and 'in' such as "Internet") and `struct sockaddr_in6` for IPv6.
The important part is: 
**A pointer to a `struct sockaddr_in` can be cast to a pointer to a `struct sockaddr` and vice-versa. So even though `connect()` wants a `struct sockaddr*`, you can still use a `struct sockaddr_in` and cast it at the last minute!**
```c
// (IPv4 only--see struct sockaddr_in6 for IPv6)
struct sockaddr_in
{
	short int           sin_family;     // Address family, AF_INET
	unsigned short int  sin_port;       // Port number
	struct in_addr      sin_addr;       // Internet address
	unsigned char       sin_zero[8];    // Same size as struct sockaddr
};
```
This structure makes it easy to reference elements of the socket address.
- `sin_family`:
	Address family and corresponds to `sa_family`, it should be set to AF_INET.
- `sin_port`:
	Port number bust my in Network Byte Order, using `htons()`.
- `sin_zero`:
	Padding to match the length of a struct sockaddr, should be set to all zeros using memset().
- `sin_addr`:
	Is a `struct in_addr`
	```c
	// (IPv4 only--see struct in6_addr for IPv6)
	// Internet address (a structure for historical reasons)
	struct in_addr
	{
		uint32_t    s_addr; // that's a 32-bit int (4 bytes), the IP adress
	};
	```
To clarify, lets say we declared the `struct sockaddr_in` to be `ina` then we can simply extract the IP adress with `ina.sin_addr.s_addr`.
IPv6 on the other hand uses different structures:
```c
// (IPv6 only--see struct sockaddr_in and struct in_addr for IPv4)
struct sockaddr_in6
{
	u_int16_t		sin6_family; 	// address family, AF_INET6
	u_int16_t		sin6_port; 		// port number, Network Byte Order
	u_int32_t		sin6_flowinfo;	// IPv6 flow information
	struct in6_addr sin6_addr;		// IPv6 address
	u_int32_t 		sin6_scope_id;	// Scope ID
};

struct in6_addr
{
	unsigned char	s6_addr[16];	// IPv6 address
};
```
Note that IPv6 has an IPv6 adress and a port number just like IPv4. The IPv6 flow information and the scope ID are not relevant for now.
The last structure is `struct sockaddr_storage`, which is large enough to hold both, IPv4 and IPv6 structures. This is espacially useful when you make calls without knowing if it will fill `struct sockaddr` with an IPv4 or IPv6 address. Here you can just cast it to the respective type.
```c
struct sockaddr_storage
{
	sa_family_t	ss_family; // address family
	// all this is padding, implementation specific, ignore it:
	char		__ss_pad1[_SS_PAD1SIZE];
	int64_t		__ss_align;
	char		__ss_pad2[_SS_PAD2SIZE];
};
```
- `ss_family`:
	Indicates the type of as either `AF_INET` or `AF_INET6`. Then the whole structure can be casted on `struct sockaddr_in` or `struct sockaddr_in6`.

#### 3.7 IP Addresses Part 2
If you want to transform IP addresses from numbers-and-dots notation to `struct in_addr` or `struct in6_addr` then you can use the function `inet_pton()` (pton = presentation to network / "printable to network"). 
```c
struct sockaddr_in	sa;		// IPv4
struct sockaddr_in6	sa6;	// IPv6
inet_pton(AF_INET, "10.12.110.57", &(sa.sin_addr)); // IPv4
inet_pton(AF_INET6, "2001:db8:63b3:1::3490", &(sa6.sin6_addr)); // IPv6
```
Careful the above code doesn't include any error checking.
There is also the other way around so to print the IP address as a numbers-and-dots notation you can use the function `inet_ntop()` (ntop = network to presentation / "network to printable"):
```c
// IPv4:
char				ip4[INET_ADDRSTRLEN];	// space to hold the IPv4 string
struct sockaddr_in	sa; 					// pretend this is loaded with something
inet_ntop(AF_INET, &(sa.sin_addr), ip4, INET_ADDRSTRLEN);
printf("The IPv4 address is: %s\n", ip4);

// IPv6:
char				ip6[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN];	// space to hold the IPv6 string
struct sockaddr_in6	sa6;					// pretend this is loaded with something
inet_ntop(AF_INET6, &(sa6.sin6_addr), ip6, INET6_ADDRSTRLEN);
printf("The address is: %s\n", ip6);
```
- `INET_ADDRSTRLEN`: This macro holds the maximum size of a string for IPv4.
- `INET6_ADDRSTRLEN`: This macro holds the maximum size of a string for IPv6.

Those functions won't do any nameserver DNS lookup, but this can be done with the function `getaddrinfo()`.

#### 3.8 Private or disconnected Networks
	Private networks are often protected by firewalls and use Network Address Translation (NAT) to translate internal IP addresses to external ones. NAT allows multiple devices to share the same external IP address. Private networks typically use reserved IP address ranges such as 10.x.x.x and 192.168.x.x. IPv6 also has private networks starting with fdXX: or fcXX:. NAT and IPv6 are not commonly used together.


### Chapter 4: Jumping from IPv4 to IPv6
To make your code work with IPv6, here are the key changes you need to make:
1. Use `getaddrinfo()` to obtain the `struct sockaddr` information instead of manually packing the structures.
2. Wrap any hard-coded IP version-related code in helper functions.
3. Change `AF_INET` to `AF_INET6`.
4. Change `PF_INET` to `PF_INET6`.
5. Replace `INADDR_ANY` assignments with `in6addr_any` assignments. For example:
	```c
	struct sockaddr_in sa;
	struct sockaddr_in6 sa6;
	sa.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; // use my IPv4 address
	sa6.sin6_addr = in6addr_any; // use my IPv6 address
	```
	You can also use `IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT` as an initializer for `struct in6_addr`.
6. Use `struct sockaddr_in6` instead of `struct sockaddr_in`, making sure to update the fields accordingly.
7. Use `struct in6_addr` instead of `struct in_addr`, updating the fields as needed.
8. Replace `inet_aton()` or `inet_addr()` with `inet_pton()`.
9. Replace `inet_ntoa()` with `inet_ntop()`.
10. Replace `gethostbyname()` with the superior `getaddrinfo()`.
11. Replace `gethostbyaddr()` with the superior `getnameinfo()`, although `gethostbyaddr()` can still work with IPv6.
12. Use IPv6 multicast instead of `INADDR_BROADCAST`.


### Chapter 5: System Calls or Bust
#### 5.1 `getaddrinfo()` - Prepare to launch!
This function is very useful and pretty simple, it will do everything for you. It works for both IPv4 and IPv6 and it can do DNS and service name lookups and then fills out the `struct`s you need.
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>

int getaddrinfo(const char *node, 				// e.g. "www.example.com" or IP
				const char *service, 			// e.g. "http" or port number
				const struct addrinfo *hints,
				struct addrinfo **res);
```
- `getaddrinfo()`: function takes three input parameters and returns a pointer to a linked-list of `res` results. 
- `node`: parameter represents the host name or IP address to connect to. 
- `service`: parameter can be a port number or service name. 
- `hints`: parameter contains relevant information about the desired address. 
The function performs address resolution and returns a linked-list `res` of `struct addrinfo` with the resolved addresses. This is because a single host name or IP address can have multiple associated addresses, such as IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The linked-list allows you to iterate through all the resolved addresses and choose the one that best suits your needs.

The next code block shows a call if you're a webserver who wants to listen on your host's IP adress, port 3490. Note it does not do any listening or network setup it just initialzes the structures.
```c
int				status;
struct addrinfo	hints;
struct addrinfo	*servinfo; 			// will point to the results

memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);	// make sure the struct is empty
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;		// don't care IPv4 or IPv6
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;	// TCP stream sockets
hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;		// fill in my IP for me

if ((status = getaddrinfo(NULL, "3490", &hints, &servinfo)) != 0) {
	fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo error: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
	exit(1);
}

// servinfo now points to a linked list of 1 or more struct addrinfos

// ... do everything until you don't need servinfo anymore ....

freeaddrinfo(servinfo); // free the linked-list
```
- `AF_UNSPEC`: IPv4 or IPv6 does not matter, it will be resolved automatically. But you could also use `AF_INET` or `AF_INET6` if you want to be specific.
- `AI_PASSIVE`: This means that it will automatically assign the address of my local host to the socket structures. Now I don't need to hardcode it and the first parameter of `getaddrinfo()`, the `node` can be `NULL`.
We make the call. if the call is not successfull, we can print the error using the `gai_strerror()` function.
If no error occours, `servinfo` will point to linked list of `struct addrinfo`, each of which contains `struct sockaddr`.
At the end we should free the allocated structures by calling `freeaddrinfo(servinfo)`.
Hereâs a sample call if youâre a client who wants to connect to a particular server, say âwww.example.netâ port 3490:
```c
int status;
struct addrinfo hints;
struct addrinfo *servinfo; // will point to the results

memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints)); // make sure the struct is empty
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC; // don't care IPv4 or IPv6
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // TCP stream sockets

// get ready to connect
status = getaddrinfo("www.example.net", "3490", &hints, &servinfo);

// servinfo now points to a linked list of 1 or more struct addrinfos

// etc.
```
In the next step let's compile the code below to check how linked lists work. Different website somtimes use several IP's try it for example with "netflix.com". The code below is already in the file showip.c, it just needs to be compiled and run.
```c
/*
** showip.c -- show IP addresses for a host given on the command line
*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	struct addrinfo hints, *res, *p;
	int status;
	char ipstr[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN];

	if (argc != 2) {
		fprintf(stderr,"usage: showip hostname\n");
		return 1;
	}

	memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints));
	hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC; // AF_INET or AF_INET6 to force version
	hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;

	if ((status = getaddrinfo(argv[1], NULL, &hints, &res)) != 0) {
		fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
		return 2;
	}

	printf("IP addresses for %s:\n\n", argv[1]);

	for(p = res;p != NULL; p = p->ai_next) {
		void *addr;
		char *ipver;

		// get the pointer to the address itself,
		// different fields in IPv4 and IPv6:
		if (p->ai_family == AF_INET) { // IPv4
			struct sockaddr_in *ipv4 = (struct sockaddr_in *)p->ai_addr;
			addr = &(ipv4->sin_addr);
			ipver = "IPv4";
		} else { // IPv6
			struct sockaddr_in6 *ipv6 = (struct sockaddr_in6 *)p->ai_addr;
			addr = &(ipv6->sin6_addr);
			ipver = "IPv6";
		}

		// convert the IP to a string and print it:
		inet_ntop(p->ai_family, addr, ipstr, sizeof(ipstr));
		printf("  %s: %s\n", ipver, ipstr);
	}

	freeaddrinfo(res); // free the linked list

	return 0;
}
```
By passing `NULL` as the service name or port number, the code is indicating that it doesn't require information about a specific service or port. It simply wants to obtain the address information for the given host.

#### 5.2 `socket()` - Get the File Descriptor!
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
```
The arguments determine what kind of socket you want. Those values can be hardcoded or we just use the available macros.
- `domain`: is `PF_INET` for IPv4 or `PF_INET6` for IPv6. `PF_INET` is closely related to `AF_INET`, so close that they are the same value and many programmers pass `AF_INET` instead. 
- `type`: is `SOCK_STREAM` or `SOCK_DGRAM`.
- `protocol`: can be set to 0 to choose to proper protocol for the given type. You can call `getprotobyname()` to look up the protocol you want ("tcp" or "udp").
The function returns a simple *socket descriptor* just like a file descriptor.
The difference between AF and PF is that AF (Address Family) is used when initializing the `sin_family` field in `struct sockaddr_in`, while PF (Protocol Family) is used as the first argument in the `socket()` function. Although AF_INET and PF_INET have the same value, it is more correct to use AF_INET in `struct sockaddr_in` and PF_INET in the `socket()` function call. They both exist beacause it was once thought that one address family might support several protocol families but that didnt happen. 
But we actually want to use the results from `getaddrinfo()`and feed them into the `socket()`.
```c
int s;
struct addrinfo hints, *res;

// do the lookup
// [pretend we already filled out the "hints" struct]
getaddrinfo("www.example.com", "http", &hints, &res);

// again, you should do error-checking on getaddrinfo(), and walk
// the "res" linked list looking for valid entries instead of just
// assuming the first one is good (like many of these examples do).
// See the section on client/server for real examples.

s = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);
```
If the call to socket fails, `s` will be set to -1 and the errno will be set accordingly.

#### 5.3 `bind()` - What port am I on?
To associate a socket with a port on your local machine, you can use the `bind()` system call. Here is the synopsis for the `bind()` function:
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
int bind(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *my_addr, int addrlen);
```
- `sockfd`: The socket file descriptor returned by `socket()`.
- `my_addr`: A pointer to a `struct sockaddr` that contains information about your address, including the port and IP address.
- `addrlen`: The length in bytes of the address.

Here's an example that binds the socket to the host the program is running on, port 3490:
```c
struct addrinfo hints, *res;
int sockfd;

// Load up address structs with getaddrinfo()
memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC; // Use IPv4 or IPv6, whichever
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE; // Fill in my IP for me

getaddrinfo(NULL, "3490", &hints, &res);

// Make a socket
sockfd = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);

// Bind it to the port passed in to getaddrinfo()
bind(sockfd, res->ai_addr, res->ai_addrlen);
```
By using the `AI_PASSIVE` flag, the program binds to the IP of the host it's running on. If you want to bind to a specific local IP address, you can drop the `AI_PASSIVE` flag and provide an IP address as the first argument to `getaddrinfo()`.
It's worth noting that `bind()` returns -1 on error and sets `errno` to the error's value.
In older code, the `struct sockaddr_in` was manually packed before calling `bind()`. Here's an example:
```c
// !!! THIS IS THE OLD WAY !!!

int sockfd;
struct sockaddr_in my_addr;

sockfd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

my_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
my_addr.sin_port = htons(MYPORT); // Short, network byte order
my_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("10.12.110.57");
memset(my_addr.sin_zero, '\0', sizeof my_addr.sin_zero);

bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&my_addr, sizeof(my_addr));
```
In the above code, you could also assign `INADDR_ANY` to the `s_addr` field if you wanted to bind to your local IP address. For IPv6, you can use the `in6addr_any` variable or the `IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT` macro.
Keep in mind that ports below 1024 are reserved, unless you're the superuser. You can use any port number above 1024, up to 65535, as long as it's not already being used by another program.
If you encounter the "Address already in use" error when calling `bind()`, it means that a socket connected to that port is still active in the kernel. You can either wait for it to clear or add code to your program to allow reusing the port by setting the `SO_REUSEADDR` option using `setsockopt()`.
```c
int yes = 1;
//char yes = '1'; // Solaris people use this

// lose the pesky "Address already in use" error message
if (setsockopt(listener, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &yes, sizeof(yes)) == -1) {
	perror("setsockopt");
	exit(1);
}
```
One final note: there are cases where you don't necessarily have to call `bind()`. If you're only `connect()`ing to a remote machine and don't care about the local port, you can simply call `connect()`. It will check if the socket is unbound and bind it to an unused local port if necessary.

#### 5.4 `connect()` - Hey, you!
The `connect()` function is used to establish a connection to a remote host.
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int connect(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *serv_addr, int addrlen);
```
- `sockfd`: The socket file descriptor returned by the `socket()` call.
- `serv_addr`: A pointer to a `struct sockaddr` that contains the destination port and IP address.
- `addrlen`: The length in bytes of the server address structure.

To use `connect()`, we first need to obtain the address information using the `getaddrinfo()` function. Here's an example that connects to "www.example.com" on port 3490:

```c
struct addrinfo hints, *res;
int sockfd;

// Load up address structs with getaddrinfo()
memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;

getaddrinfo("www.example.com", "3490", &hints, &res);

// Make a socket
sockfd = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);

// Connect
connect(sockfd, res->ai_addr, res->ai_addrlen);
```
It's important to check the return value of `connect()`, as it will return -1 on error and set the `errno` variable accordingly.
Note that in this example, we didn't call `bind()`. We don't need to specify a local port number, as the kernel will choose one for us. We only care about the remote port we're connecting to.

#### 5.5 `listen()` - Will somebody please call me?
The `listen()` function is used to wait for incoming connections and handle them in some way. It takes two parameters:
```c
int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);
```
- `sockfd`: The socket file descriptor returned by the `socket()` call.
- `backlog`: The number of connections allowed on the incoming queue. This determines how many connections can wait in the queue until they are accepted.

The `listen()` function should be called after the `bind()` function, which binds the server to a specific port. The sequence of system calls for listening for incoming connections is as follows:
1. `getaddrinfo()`: Obtain the address information.
2. `socket()`: Create a socket.
3. `bind()`: Bind the socket to a specific port.
4. `listen()`: Start listening for incoming connections.
5. `/* accept() goes here */`: Handle the incoming connections.

Here is an example of how to use `listen()`:
```c
struct addrinfo hints, *res;
int sockfd;

// Load up address structs with getaddrinfo()
memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;

getaddrinfo("www.example.com", "3490", &hints, &res);

// Make a socket
sockfd = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);

// Bind
bind(sockfd, res->ai_addr, res->ai_addrlen);

// Listen
listen(sockfd, 5); // Allow up to 5 connections in the queue
```
Remember to handle the return value of `listen()`, as it will return -1 on error and set the `errno` variable accordingly.
The `accept()` function is used to accept incoming connections.

#### 5.6 `accept()` - "Thank you for calling port 3490."
The `accept()` function is used to accept incoming connections on a listening socket. When a remote host tries to connect to your machine on a specific port, their connection is queued up waiting to be accepted. The `accept()` call retrieves the pending connection and **returns a new socket file descriptor** for that specific connection. This allows you to have multiple connections simultaneously, with the original socket still listening for new connections.

The accept() function is called as follows:
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen);
```
- `sockfd`: The listening socket descriptor.
- `addr`: A pointer to a struct sockaddr where information about the incoming connection will be stored.
- `addrlen`: The length of the address structure.
It's important to set the `addrlen` variable to `sizeof(struct sockaddr)` before passing its address to `accept()`. The function will update `addrlen` to reflect the actual number of bytes stored in `addr`.
If an error occurs, `accept()` returns -1 and sets errno.
Here's an example code fragment that demonstrates the usage of `accept()`:
```c
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>

#define MYPORT "3490" // the port users will be connecting to
#define BACKLOG 10 // how many pending connections queue will hold

int main(void)
{
	struct sockaddr_storage their_addr;
	socklen_t addr_size;
	struct addrinfo hints, *res;
	int sockfd, new_fd;

	// !! don't forget your error checking for these calls !!

	// first, load up address structs with getaddrinfo():
	memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints));
	hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC; // use IPv4 or IPv6, whichever
	hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
	hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE; // fill in my IP for me

	getaddrinfo(NULL, MYPORT, &hints, &res);

	// make a socket, bind it, and listen on it:
	sockfd = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);
	bind(sockfd, res->ai_addr, res->ai_addrlen);
	listen(sockfd, BACKLOG);

	// now accept an incoming connection:
	addr_size = sizeof(their_addr);
	new_fd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *) &their_addr, &addr_size);

	// ready to communicate on socket descriptor new_fd!
	// ...
}
```
Remember to handle errors and close the listening sockfd if you don't want to accept more incoming connections.

#### 5.7 - `send()` and `recv()` - Talk to me, baby!
The `send()` function is used to send data over stream sockets or connected datagram sockets. Here is the `send()` function call:
```c
int send(int sockfd, const void *msg, int len, int flags);
```
- `sockfd`: The socket descriptor you want to send data to.
- `msg`: A pointer to the data you want to send.
- `len`: The length of the data in bytes.
- `flags`: Set to 0 (see `man send()` for more information).

Here's an example code snippet:
```c
char *msg = "Beej was here!";
int len, bytes_sent;

len = strlen(msg);
bytes_sent = send(sockfd, msg, len, 0);
```
The `send()` function returns the number of bytes actually sent out, which may be less than the number you specified. If the return value doesn't match the value in `len`, you need to send the remaining data. If an error occurs, `-1` is returned and `errno` is set.

The `recv()` function is used to receive data from a socket. Here are the input parameters:
```c
int recv(int sockfd, void *buf, int len, int flags);
```
- `sockfd`: The socket descriptor to read from.
- `buf`: The buffer to read the information into.
- `len`: The maximum length of the buffer.
- `flags`: Set to 0 (see `man recv()` for more information).
The `recv()` function returns the number of bytes actually read into the buffer, or `-1` on error. If the return value is `0`, it means that the remote side has closed the connection.
Remember to handle errors and check the return values of these functions.

#### 5.8 `sendto()` and `recvfrom()` - Talk to me, DGRAM-style
`sendto()` and `recvfrom()` are functions used for sending and receiving data over a network using unconnected datagram sockets. Since datagram sockets are unconnected to a remote host and in contrast to `send()` and `recv()` we need the destination address before we can send the packet.

To send data over an unconnected datagram socket, we use the `sendto()` function:
```c
int sendto(int sockfd, const void *msg, int len, unsigned int flags, const struct sockaddr *to, socklen_t tolen);
```
- Syntax: `int sendto(int sockfd, const void *msg, int len, unsigned int flags, const struct sockaddr *to, socklen_t tolen)`
- `sockfd`: The socket file descriptor.
- `msg`: A pointer to the data to be sent.
- `len`: The length of the data in bytes.
- `flags`: Flags for the send operation.
- `to`: A pointer to a `struct sockaddr` that contains the destination IP address and port.
- `tolen`: The length of the `to` address structure.
The `sendto()` function returns the number of bytes actually sent or -1 on error.

To receive data from an unconnected datagram socket, we use the `recvfrom()` function:
```c
int recvfrom(int sockfd, void *buf, int len, unsigned int flags, struct sockaddr *from, int *fromlen);
```
- `sockfd`: The socket file descriptor.
- `buf`: A pointer to the buffer where the received data will be stored.
- `len`: The maximum length of the buffer.
- `flags`: Flags for the receive operation.
- `from`: A pointer to a `struct sockaddr_storage` that will be filled with the IP address and port of the originating machine.
- `fromlen`: A pointer to an integer that should be initialized to the size of `from` structure.
The `recvfrom()` function returns the number of bytes received or -1 on error.
The use of `struct sockaddr_storage` as the socket type allows us to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
If a datagram socket is connected using `connect()`, we can use `send()` and `recv()` functions for sending and receiving data, respectively. The socket interface will automatically add the destination and source information.
Remember to handle errors and check the return values of these functions.

#### 5.9 `close()` and `shutdown()` - Get outta my face!
